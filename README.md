Code and notes from Frontend-Masters

In this repos, I document my course on becoming a frontend engineer
https://frontendmasters.com/learn/professional/
Go From Professional Web Developer to Lead Engineer
An amazing course I highly recommend, as it is helping me in my job at Moltomedia, I currently do frontend(JQuery + HTML + JS + CSS..) and backend PHP (TYPO3, ShopWare).
Taking this course helps me in my design and JS skill in so many ways!
In this course you can learn from Will Sentance (codesmith), Kyle Simpson ( @getify you don't Know JS ), 
Brian holt (Microsoft, Netflix), Estelle Weyl (Mozilla Dev Network)
and Jem Young( Netflix).
